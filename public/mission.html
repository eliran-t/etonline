    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>**The Tech world is moving fast â€“ but now... it's accelerating!**
        We're entering a whole new era of technology, and the early adopters will be the big winners.    
       
        With my 20+ years of IT experience, I understand the power of AI and automation, 
        but I also understand the fear and hesitation it creates in those who aren't tech-savvy. 
       
        That's where I come in. I'm eager to help small businesses and interested individuals 
        find the balanced tech solutions that work for them (pun intended). 
        
        It's not just about boosting quality, productivity and profits,
        it's also about adapting to the new reality instead of pulling away and staying behind.

        When everyone is promising AI solutions, I intend on bringing HiAi (Human-ified Artificial Intelligence). 
        Because not everything should be artificial.
